### M02 Programming Assignment - Part 1
In this assignment, we are demostrated on how to write simple programs.

A cookie recipe calls for the following ingredients:

```
- 1.5 cups of sugar
- 1 cup of butter
- 2.75 cups of flour
```

The recipe produces 48 cookies with this amount of the ingredients. This program will ask the user how many cookies he or she wants to make, then displays the number of cups of each ingredient needed for the user specified number of cookies.

This is the output of this specific code:

### M02 Programming Assignment - Part 2
In this assignment, We will write a program that informs a user of their meal charge. Create a variable and assign it a value for the meal charge (e.g. $32.95). The program should then compute the tax and tip on the restaurant bill. The tax should be 6.75 percent of the meal cost. The tip should be 20 percent of the total after adding the tax.

Display the meal cost, tax amount, tip amount, and total bill on the screen.

This is the output of this specific code:

### M03 Lecture Lab Activity 1
In this assignment, we will write a C++ program that takes that user input of number grade and coverts it to a letter.

This is the output of this specific code:

### M03 Programming Assignment - Part 1
A triangle has three sides where the sum of the length of two of the sides must exceed the other side. In a right traingle, the square of the length of one side is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In this assignment, we will write a program that prompts the user to enter the legths of three sides. The program will output a message indicating whether or not the lengths form a triangle and, if so, outputs a message indicating you have a valid triangle and wheter or not the triangle is a right trinagle.

We are required to use a nested if statement to check if three sides makes a right triangle, if nested if statement is not used, we will get deducted points.

This is the output of this specific code:

### M03 Programming Assignment - Part 2
Write a program that calculates and displays a person's body mass index (BMI). The BMI is often used to determine wether a person with a sedentary lifestyle is overweight or underweight for his or her height. A person's BMI is calculated with the following formula:

$BMI = weight x 703/height^2$

Where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches.

The program should display the calculated BMI along with a message indicating whether the person has optimal weight, is underweight, or is overweight.

A person's weight is considered to be optimal if his or her BMI is between 18.5 and 25. If the BMI is less than 18.5, the person is considered to be underweight. If the BMI value is greater than 25, the person is considered to be oevrweight.

This is the output of this specific code:

## Module 4
### M04 Lecture Lab Activity 1
Write a C++ file that initializes the health of a player to 100 and enters a damage number of choice, finally displays if the player is still alive by using the Flag-controlled while loop.

Exmaple output:
```
This program calculates the health level of a player and displays it on the screen.
Enter damage: 20
The player is alive, the current health level is 80.
Enter damage: 100
Sorry, the player is dead.
```
This is the output of this specific code:

### M04 Lecture Lab Activity 2
Write a C++ file that calculates the Fibonacci number.

Example output:
```
Please enter a number to calculate the corresponding Fibonacci number.
If user enter 5:
Output: Fib5 is 5.
```

Note that there are two base case, Fib1 = 1, Fib2 = 1.
Formula to use: Fibn = Fib(n - 1) + Fib(n - 2).

This is the output of this specific code:

### M04 Programming Assignment - Part 1
The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:
```
distance = speed * time
```

For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for 3 hours, the distance traveled is 120 miles.

Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and how many hours it has traveled. The program should then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period. Here is an example of the output:
```
What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 40
How many hours has it traveled? 3
Hour    Distance Traveled
-------------------------
1       40
2       80
3       120
```

**Input Validation:** Do not accept a negative number for speed and do not accept any values less than 1 for time traveled. This was worth 5 points.

This is the output of this specific code:

### M04 Programming Assignment - Part 2
Write a program that converts Celcius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures. The formula is:

F = 9/5&deg;C + 32
F is the Fahrenheit temperature, and C is the Celsius temperature.

Your program should prompt the user for a lower and upper range of temperatures in Celsius. The use a loop to display a table of the Celsius temperatures and their Fahrenheit equivalents withing the range of values.

**Input Validation:** Ensure the second number is greater than the first number. This was worth 5 points.

This is the output of this specific code:
