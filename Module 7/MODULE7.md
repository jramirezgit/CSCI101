## Module 7
### M07 Lecture Lab Activity 1
Define a struct **computerType** to store the following data about a computer: Manufacturer (string), model type (string), processor type (string), ram (int) in GB, hard drive size (int) in GB, year when the computer was built (int), and the price (double).

In this assignment, we will write a program that declares a variable of type **computerType**, prompts the user to the input data for the struct, and then outputs all the computer's data from the struct.

Sample run:
```
Enter the name of the manufacturer: Dell
Enter the model of the computer: Inspiron
Enter processor type: I7 387
Enter the size of RAM (in GB): 32
Enter the size of hard drive (in GB): 512
Enter the year the computer was built: 1990
Enter the price: 1345.67

--------------------
Manufacturer: Dell
Model: Inspiron
Processor: I7 387
Ram: 32
Hard Drive Size: 512
Year Built: 1990
Price: $1345.67
```

This is the output of this specific code:

### M07 Programming Assignment - Part 1
In this assignment, we will create a program that uses a structure named **MovieData** to store the following information about a movie:
```
Title
Genre
Director
Year Released
Running time (in minutes)
```

We will write a program that prompts the user for input and allows all of these member data values to be specified. The program should create two **MovieData** variables and create/use a method **displayMovie(MovieData)** to display the information about the movie in a clearly formatted manner.

This is the output of this specific code:

### M07 Programming Assignment - Part 2
In this assignment, we will write a program that uses two structures **Name** and **Student** to store the following information for multiple students:

1. Create a NAME structure that consists of
    * First Name,
    * Middle Initial, and
    * Last Name.
2. Create a STUDENT structure that contains student information (Include the NAME structure within the Student information structure):
    * Name
    * ID
    * email
    * SSN
    *Program (an enum type containing programs such as CSCI, DBMS, INFM, SDEV)  (5 points)
