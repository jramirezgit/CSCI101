## Module 6
### M06 Programming Assignment - Part 1
In this assignment, we will write a program that analyzes a year’s worth of rainfall data. The program should accept the total rainfall for each of 12 months from the user and store it in an array of doubles. The program should then compute the totalRainfall, averageRainfall, driestMonth, and wettestMonth.

An array containing the string for each month’s name should also be created. The index values of both arrays should correlate to the same month - this will allow you to utilize the array of strings when displaying the names of each month when prompting for the rainfall amounts and then when displaying the statistics.

This information should be used by main to print a summary rainfall report similar to the following:
```
Annual Rain Report for <enter your county name here> County

Total rainfall: 23.19 inches

Average monthly rainfall: 1.93 inches

The least rain fell in January with 0.24 inches.

The most rain fell in April with 4.29 inches.
```

This is the output of this specific code:

### M06 Programming Assignment - Part 2
In this assignment, we will write a program that uses a two-dimensional array to store the highest and lowest temperatures for each month of the year. The program should output the average high, average low, and the highest and lowest temperatures for the year. Your program must consist of the following functions:

Function **getData:** This function reads and stores data in the two- dimensional array.
Function **averageHigh:** This function calculates and returns the aver- age high temperature for the year.
Function **averageLow:** This function calculates and returns the average low temperature for the year.
Function **indexHighTemp:** This function returns the index of the highest high temperature in the array.
Function **indexLowTemp:** This function returns the index of the lowest low temperature in the array.

These functions must all have the appropriate parameters.

This is the output of this specific code:
