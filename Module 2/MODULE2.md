## Module 2
### M02 Programming Assignment - Part 1
In this assignment, we are demostrated on how to write simple programs.

A cookie recipe calls for the following ingredients:

```
- 1.5 cups of sugar
- 1 cup of butter
- 2.75 cups of flour
```

The recipe produces 48 cookies with this amount of the ingredients. This program will ask the user how many cookies he or she wants to make, then displays the number of cups of each ingredient needed for the user specified number of cookies.

This is the output of this specific code:

### M02 Programming Assignment - Part 2
In this assignment, We will write a program that informs a user of their meal charge. Create a variable and assign it a value for the meal charge (e.g. $32.95). The program should then compute the tax and tip on the restaurant bill. The tax should be 6.75 percent of the meal cost. The tip should be 20 percent of the total after adding the tax.

Display the meal cost, tax amount, tip amount, and total bill on the screen.

This is the output of this specific code:
