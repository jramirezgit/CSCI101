## Module 3
### M03 Lecture Lab Activity 1
In this assignment, we will write a C++ program that takes that user input of number grade and coverts it to a letter.

This is the output of this specific code:

### M03 Programming Assignment - Part 1
A triangle has three sides where the sum of the length of two of the sides must exceed the other side. In a right traingle, the square of the length of one side is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In this assignment, we will write a program that prompts the user to enter the legths of three sides. The program will output a message indicating whether or not the lengths form a triangle and, if so, outputs a message indicating you have a valid triangle and wheter or not the triangle is a right trinagle.

We are required to use a nested if statement to check if three sides makes a right triangle, if nested if statement is not used, we will get deducted points.

This is the output of this specific code:

### M03 Programming Assignment - Part 2
In this assignment, we will write a program that calculates and displays a person's body mass index (BMI). The BMI is often used to determine wether a person with a sedentary lifestyle is overweight or underweight for his or her height. A person's BMI is calculated with the following formula:

$$
BMI = weight x 703/height^2
$$

Where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches.

The program should display the calculated BMI along with a message indicating whether the person has optimal weight, is underweight, or is overweight.

A person's weight is considered to be optimal if his or her BMI is between 18.5 and 25. If the BMI is less than 18.5, the person is considered to be underweight. If the BMI value is greater than 25, the person is considered to be overweight.
