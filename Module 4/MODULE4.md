## Module 4
### M04 Lecture Lab Activity 1
In this assignment, we will write a C++ file that initializes the health of a player to 100 and enters a damage number of choice, finally displays if the player is still alive by using the Flag-controlled while loop.

Exmaple output:
```
This program calculates the health level of a player and displays it on the screen.
Enter damage: 20
The player is alive, the current health level is 80.
Enter damage: 100
Sorry, the player is dead.
```
This is the output of this specific code:

### M04 Lecture Lab Activity 2
In this assignment, we will write a C++ file that calculates the Fibonacci number.

Example output:
```
Please enter a number to calculate the corresponding Fibonacci number.
If user enter 5:
Output: Fib5 is 5.
```

Note that there are two base case, Fib1 = 1, Fib2 = 1.
Formula to use: Fibn = Fib(n - 1) + Fib(n - 2).

This is the output of this specific code:

### M04 Programming Assignment - Part 1
The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:
```
distance = speed * time
```

For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for 3 hours, the distance traveled is 120 miles.

In this assignment, we will write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and how many hours it has traveled. The program should then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period. Here is an example of the output:
```
What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 40
How many hours has it traveled? 3
Hour    Distance Traveled
-------------------------
1       40
2       80
3       120
```

**Input Validation:** Do not accept a negative number for speed and do not accept any values less than 1 for time traveled. This was worth 5 points.

This is the output of this specific code:

### M04 Programming Assignment - Part 2
In this assignment, we will write a program that converts Celcius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures. The formula is:

F = 9/5&deg;C + 32

F is the Fahrenheit temperature, and C is the Celsius temperature.

The program should prompt the user for a lower and upper range of temperatures in Celsius. Then use a loop to display a table of the Celsius temperatures and their Fahrenheit equivalents withing the range of values.

**Input Validation:** Ensure the second number is greater than the first number. This was worth 5 points.

This is the output of this specific code:
